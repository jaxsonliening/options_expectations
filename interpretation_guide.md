# Probability Arbitrage Interpretation Guide

**"Differentiation comes from diverging on Magnitude (Price) or Likelihood (Probability)."**

This tool calculates the **Market's Base Rate** (what is priced in). It does not tell you what *will* happen; it tells you what the market *fears* will happen.

## The Core Concept: Probability Gap

To generate Alpha, you must identify a gap between **Market Implied Probability** ($\mathbb{P}_{mkt}$) and **Fundamental Conviction** ($\mathbb{P}_{fund}$).

$$\text{Edge} = \mathbb{P}_{fund} - \mathbb{P}_{mkt}$$

* **$\mathbb{P}_{mkt}$ (The Tool):** Reflects consensus, hedging flows, and risk aversion.
* **$\mathbb{P}_{fund}$ (Your Research):** Reflects idiosyncratic factors (moats, catalysts, management execution).

## The Conviction Matrix

Use this matrix to categorize your investment thesis:

| Your Target vs. Market | Your Probability vs. Market | **The Trade Classification** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Higher** | **Higher** | **High Conviction Long (Double Alpha)**<br>You see higher upside *and* significantly lower risk than the market. |
| **Same** | **Higher** | **Probability Arbitrage**<br>The market respects the price target but views it as a "Long Shot" (e.g., 20% prob). You view it as likely (e.g., 60% prob). |
| **Higher** | **Same** | **Value / Magnitude Play**<br>You agree on the execution risk, but believe the asset's payoff is fundamentally larger. |
| **Same** | **Same** | **Consensus (No Edge)**<br>Do not pitch. The stock is fairly priced relative to risk. |

## How to Pitch the Data

Do not say: *"The tool says the probability is 30%, so we used 30%."* (This is circular logic).

**Say this instead:**
> "The options market is currently pricing in a defensive posture, assigning only a **30% probability** to our Bull Case. However, our research into [Unique Catalyst] suggests the true probability of execution is closer to **60%**. We are buying this mispricing of risk."

## Red Flags (When to Abandon the Thesis)

1.  **The "Crowded Short" Signal:** You want to short, but the tool shows the Market-Implied EV is *already* far below the Spot Price. The market agrees with you; puts will be too expensive to generate a return.
2.  **The "Priced for Perfection" Signal:** You want to go long, but the Market-Implied EV is *already* far above the Spot Price (with High Gamma). The market is already pricing in a massive breakout; any stumble will be catastrophic.
